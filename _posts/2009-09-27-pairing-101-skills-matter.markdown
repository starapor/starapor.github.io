A few weeks ago, my good buddy [Christian Blunden](http://christianralph.blogspot.com/) and myself presented at a London Geek Night. For us, it was quite fun and I hope people not only picked something up from it but also had a good time. The presentation was recorded and should be on [skills matter](http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/java-jee/pairing-101) so check it out if your interested (she says cringing at watching herself on video).
