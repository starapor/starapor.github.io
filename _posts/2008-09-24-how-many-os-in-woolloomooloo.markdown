I am often asked how to pronounce my surname. It's not too difficult, but for your benefit, I will now attempt at a phonetic guide to my last name. 

Essentially, it can be broken down into 3 parts: **tara** - **pore** - **walla**. 

## Tara

pronounced ta-ra. Like the girls name; like the house in Gone With The Wind (but without Vivian Leigh's accent please.)

## Pore

pronounced like pour or poor. The 'e' is silent.

## Walla

pronounced wa-lla. Not wall-a.

Put it all together and you get :
**ta** - **ra** - **pour** - **wa** - **lla**


I hope that helps. Please feel free to let me know how you thought it was pronounced or spelt.
 

The title of this post comes from a riddle by C.J.Dennis:
> How many O's in Woolloomooloo?
> Two for the W, two for the M
> Four for the Ls and thats plenty of them.
> (Woolloomoloo is a suburb of Sydney, Australia)


Oh - and I have one vowel for every consonant (I always lump the double Ls together)
