As we shift to self isolating and working from home it’s important to remember that when we are in the office we do move around quite a bit. Think about your day:

- you walk between your car park or public transport spot into your office
- you get up from your desk and walk to standup
- you move around into meeting rooms
- you walk to get your lunch from either the work kitchen, or outside cafe
- you walk to grab your cup of joe from your favourite caffeine vendor

We move around a fair bit. 

Working from home might make you think you are tethered to your screen. But don’t forget to move.

Here are some things to try:

- Take a walk around the block at lunch time to get fresh air 
- Join your afternoon call from your phone and head into your backyard
- Reject all lunch time meetings, and block out that time in your calendar, so you can give yourself at least an hour a day away from your machine. Use that time to stretch and move.
- Talk to a physiotherapist to create a stretching and core building routine suitable for your level of fitness, which you can incorporate into activities around the house (like waiting for the kettle to boil)
- Pilates and personal trainers are embracing new formats to deliver you a workout in your living room. One gaining popularity is [PE with Joe](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyCLoPd4VxBvQafyve889qVcPxYEjdSTl)
- Do some yoga - my kids recommended [Cosmic Kids Yoga](https://www.cosmickids.com/) to me and I’m amazed to see them planking and downward dogging.

Focusing on movement through this crisis is one way to met your Safety of Heath needs as I described in my last post [about Heirarchy of Needs through a crisis](/leadership/hierarchy-of-needs-through-covid-crisis).
