After a few days of introspection, I have finally decided to post about my reactions to the now infamous [Perform like a p0rn star](http://www.slideshare.net/mattetti/couchdb-perform-like-a-pr0n-star) presentation and it's aftermath.

## The Presentation Itself

Looking at the presentation online, without having attended the conference, may exclude me from commenting fairly, but I just think "why"; as in, I don't get it. I think that there is a tenuous link between the pictures and the slide; one which could also be made with other images. I guess I follow [Ted Neward](http://blogs.tedneward.com/2009/05/01/On+Speaking+Trolling+Inciting+And+Growing.aspx) feelings that the same effect could of been achieved with subtle imagery, and <em>double-entendre</em>s. 

## The Audience Members

I wonder how many people in the audience thought this was inappropriate at the time. Clearly, [Sarah Allen](http://www.ultrasaurus.com/sarahblog/2009/04/gender-and-sex-at-gogaruco/) and [Sarah Mei](http://www.sarahmei.com/blog/?p=46) were uncomfortable. How many men in that room looked around to see how the 6 girls were reacting to it? I bet what they saw was an expression that read 'Oh...haha....' while really the girl's inside voices were screaming...'*groan* no, not another god-damn picture - we get it already, you are a guy...time to move on'[1]. With the obvious acceptance of the girls, perhaps the rest of the audience felt the images were ok (at least at first...I think I have seen comments from people who say that the first few pictures were good and funny but the joke wore thin). I would like to think that if I was in attendance, I would have the courage to standup and declare the inappropriateness of the presentation. In reality, I know I would not. I know this for several reasons; firstly, I would actually find that too rude.

Secondly, when at conferences or at the workplace, I try not to draw attention to the fact that I am a woman. Why do I do this? Frankly, because I wanted to be seen as a damn good developer first, and I fear what thoughts some people might have, especially some of the men who fit the stereotypical profile of a single, WoW playing, don't meet real girls unless they are an elf on WOW (who, I have come to learn are usually men playing women) guy (as irrational as it may be).

Thirdly, I know that is how I would react (ie inaction), because it is the same reaction that I give when I am sitting next to a group of developers (yes, all men) who are talking about putting their girlfriends/wives/women into their place, or commenting on the length of another woman's legs as she walks past, or other behavior which I would associate with groups of friends at a pub. At a pub, or out with friends I am quite happy for this type of discussion to take plus, but com'on guys, let's make the workplace gender-free, not equal, and leave our hormones at the door.

## "This should not offend you"

The comments along the lines of 'this should not offend you' or '[Im an Rated person](http://loudthinking.com/posts/39-im-an-r-rated-individual) - deal with it'

Quite frankly, I was not surprised. This is the same type of comments that I get whenever I mention the whole women-in-IT thing. It's also why I try to not to post too many entries on the subject matter (obviously sometimes I feel the need to speak out about the latest injustice)

## "This is bad. How about we all grow up"

Wow. Every time I read a comment like that, it negated any bad feeling I got from the other type of comments. It is great knowing that there are a large number of people out there, people of influence especially, who are on 'your side'. When people like [Martin Fowler](http://martinfowler.com/) speak out about the [Smut in Rails](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/SmutOnRails.html), it really makes you feel like you are on the right side. At [ThoughtWorks](http://www.thoughtworks.com), we had an internal discussion on a mailing list about this, and I was just waiting for someone to say 'hey, its not so bad', but still I can't believe that everyone I talk to about this strongly believes that this is inappropriate. So, thankyou for all who believe in this, and especially thankyou for all those people in a position in power who not only believe in it but also speak out about it.

## In Summary

Was I offended by the presentation? I don't know; I wasn't there, so I don't feel that I can really comment.

Was I offended by the reactions and the aftermath? Yeah, I was, although I was not surprised.

Would I want to get in my DeLorean and stop Matt from doing the presentation? Hell-to-the-no. I think that we should embrace this storm and let it be a catalyst to changing our minds, our behavior and our industry.

 

 
*Update - I corrected a few places where I used the wrong version of woman/women; also fixed grown into groan - Thanks Simon*

*[1]Note - reading back on this, I feel like I have read it somewhere before on someone else's blog/in a comment. Sorry if I have, but this is still a valid point.*
