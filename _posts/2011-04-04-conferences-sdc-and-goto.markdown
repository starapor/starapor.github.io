I have been getting my speaking voice ready, and now I am getting set to use it. This week, I am speaking about how to integrate with other systems in my talk titled [The Three Pronged Approach To Integrating Systems](http://www.scandevconf.se/2011/conference/speakers/sarah-taraporewalla/?backlnk=dp&tgday=togglewrap1) at [Scandinavian Developer Conference 2011](http://www.scandevconf.se/2011/conference/detailed-program/) in Gothenburg, Sweden. I am also running a conversation corner about feedback. If you want to follow what is going on, the hash tag is [#scandev](http://twitter.com/#!/search/%23scandev).

Next month, I will be speaking at [Goto; CPH](http://gotocon.com/cph-2011/) (in Copenhagen of course) in a talk titled [What ab(out People over Process]http://gotocon.com/cph-2011/speaker/Sarah+Taraporewalla)? I am really looking forward to this one - the form is a little looser than I usually go for but it is an accumulation of all the psychology books I have been reading of late.
