## I stand with my fellow ThoughtWorkers to condemn racism and police violence. 

We released a statement and I added my signature to it. I have quoted from it below but [read this](https://info.thoughtworks.com/rs/199-QDE-291/images/solidarity-against-racism-and-police-violence.pdf) to read the other signatures on it. 


>The brutal police killing of George Floyd has catalyzed recognition that racism cuts black lives short in every society. The Black Lives Matter movement has inspired global solidarity and determination to fight racism everywhere in all its different forms of expression.


> “I can’t breathe” has become the tragic expression of white supremacy in countries like Canada and Australia.


> “I can’t breathe” also echoes the caste-related violence in India, the xenophobia against refugees in Europe, and the colonialist violence against indigenous, black and brown people in Latin America, Africa and Asia.


> The war waged on black, brown and indigenous lives by institutionalised racism within police forces and systemic discrimination against first nations peoples, migrant workers, immigrants and asylum seekers must end.


> As ThoughtWorkers, we condemn systemic racism, all forms of discrimination, white supremacy, and
police violence. We renew our commitment to add our voices and our talents to join, support and amplify
movements working to build a world where everyone can breathe freely.
