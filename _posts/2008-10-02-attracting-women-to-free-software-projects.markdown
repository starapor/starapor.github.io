I came across an article the other day about [ten easy ways to attract women to free software projects](http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/columns/ten_easy_ways_attract_women_your_free_software_project). I am not quite sure what to make of it. All the suggestions seem to me to be very obvious. Is this because I am in the demographic they are trying to target, or is it because I work in an agile environment, where processes are continually improved?

If this is not just because I am the target audience (and no one else thinks its fairly obvious), I think I am a bit offended by it. Why mask these improvements behind a drive to attract more women. Why not adopt these "relatively simple changes" to benefit all contributors, regardless of their gender.

What do you think - obvious improvements or women-centric?
