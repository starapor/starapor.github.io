I have been getting my speaking voice ready, and now I am getting set to use it. This week, I am speaking about how to integrate with other systems in my talk titled <a href="http://www.scandevconf.se/2011/conference/speakers/sarah-taraporewalla/?backlnk=dp&tgday=togglewrap1">The Three Pronged Approach To Integrating Systems</a> at <a href="http://www.scandevconf.se/2011/conference/detailed-program/">Scandinavian Developer Conference 2011</a> in Gothenburg, Sweden. I am also running a conversation corner about feedback. If you want to follow what is going on, the hash tag is <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/search/%23scandev">#scandev</a>

Next month, I will be speaking at <a href="http://gotocon.com/cph-2011/">Goto CPH</a> (in Copenhagen of course) in a talk titled <a href="http://gotocon.com/cph-2011/speaker/Sarah+Taraporewalla">What about People over Process</a>? I am really looking forward to this one - the form is a little looser than I usually go for but it is an accumulation of all the psychology books I have been reading of late.
