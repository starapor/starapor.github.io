A few weeks ago, my good buddy <a href="http://christianralph.blogspot.com/">Christian Blunden</a> and myself presented at a London Geek Night. For us, it was quite fun and I hope people not only picked something up from it but also had a good time. The presentation was recorded and should be on <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/java-jee/pairing-101">skills matter</a> so check it out if your interested (she says cringing at watching herself on video).
