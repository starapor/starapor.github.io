I love <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/">ReSharper</a>. It makes life in Visual Studio such a breeze. You are just so productive in it, with all of its navigation tools, code completion and automatic refactorings. I tried to use Visual Studio without ReSharper the other day - it was so impeded that I swapped computers after about 5 minutes work (mind you - when I swapped, I redid the work in about 30sec). <div><br /></div><div>But, sometimes I think ReSharper makes you, the developer, dumber. Or maybe not so much dumber, but definitely less in control of the code, and therefore  makes the code wild and messy.</div><div><br /></div><div>Before I used ReSharper, I had quite a lot of information about the code base in my head. I knew how classes connected, which files and namespaces they belonged to, what the model looked like. A file rarely got too long, because that would mean I would have to scroll through the file to look for my desired class. If something had changed within a class, like the addition of new methods, I would recognize it quickly regardless of whether it was in the code path I was following.</div><div><br /></div><div>Now, I only find new features when I actively look for them. I find files that are quite long  because I never look at the whole file, only the method that ReSharper brought me to when I used it to navigate a code path. I can't describe how the classes are connected, what namespace or class individual methods are in. And the reason - because I gave ReSharper the power. I stopped being in charge of the code. I stopped inspecting the code base.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>Are we too becoming lazy? Are we reverting back into old, bad practices because ReSharper makes it just so darn easy to use? Are we becoming dumber?</div>
