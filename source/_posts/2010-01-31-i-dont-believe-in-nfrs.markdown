There is something about the phrase <em><a title="Wikipedia: Non Functional Requirements" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-functional_requirement" target="_blank">Non Functional Requirements</a></em> that I don't really like. It's the <em>Non</em> bit which gets me - I think that word makes them feel unimportant and therefore there is no pressing need to explore how they will affect the system. I have seen on many projects teams procrastinating in defining how the "NFRs" will affect what they are building - usually in the metrics around performance.

On my current project we have decided to appease my sensibilities and have called these <em><strong>Cross Functional Requirements</strong></em> to better express what they truly represent - requirements which cross all the functions we are building. So far the wording works - but we have only finished the 2nd week of inception.
