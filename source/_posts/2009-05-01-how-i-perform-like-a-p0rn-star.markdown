After a few days of introspection, I have finally decided to post about my reactions to the now infamous "<a title="Bad Presentations" href="http://www.slideshare.net/mattetti/couchdb-perform-like-a-pr0n-star" target="_blank">Perform like a p0rn star</a>" presentation and it's aftermath.

<strong>The Presentation Itself</strong>

Looking at the presentation online, without having attended the conference, may exclude me from commenting fairly, but I just think "why"; as in, I don't get it. I think that there is a tenuous link between the pictures and the slide; one which could also be made with other images. I guess I follow <a title="Ted Neward Blog" href="http://blogs.tedneward.com/2009/05/01/On+Speaking+Trolling+Inciting+And+Growing.aspx" target="_blank">Ted Neward's</a> feelings that the same effect could of been achieved with subtle imagery, and <em>double-entendre</em>s. 

<strong>The Audience Members</strong>

I wonder how many people in the audience thought this was inappropriate at the time. Clearly, <a title="Sarah Allens response" href="http://www.ultrasaurus.com/sarahblog/2009/04/gender-and-sex-at-gogaruco/" target="_blank">Sarah Allen </a>and <a title="Sarah Mei's response" href="http://www.sarahmei.com/blog/?p=46" target="_blank">Sarah Mei</a> were uncomfortable. How many men in that room looked around to see how the 6 girls were reacting to it? I bet what they saw was an expression that read 'Oh...haha....' while really the girl's inside voices were screaming...'*groan* no, not another god-damn picture - we get it already, you are a guy...time to move on'*. With the obvious acceptance of the girls, perhaps the rest of the audience felt the images were ok (at least at first...I think I have seen comments from people who say that the first few pictures were good and funny but the joke wore thin). I would like to think that if I was in attendance, I would have the courage to standup and declare the inappropriateness of the presentation. In reality, I know I would not. I know this for several reasons; firstly, I would actually find that too rude.

Secondly, when at conferences or at the workplace, I try not to draw attention to the fact that I am a woman. Why do I do this? Frankly, because I wanted to be seen as a damn good developer first, and I fear what thoughts some people might have, especially some of the men who fit the stereotypical profile of a single, WoW playing, don't meet real girls unless they are an elf on WOW (who, I have come to learn are usually men playing women) guy (as irrational as it may be).

Thirdly, I know that is how I would react (ie inaction), because it is the same reaction that I give when I am sitting next to a group of developers (yes, all men) who are talking about putting their girlfriends/wives/women into their place, or commenting on the length of another woman's legs as she walks past, or other behavior which I would associate with groups of friends at a pub. At a pub, or out with friends I am quite happy for this type of discussion to take plus, but com'on guys, let's make the workplace gender-free, not equal, and leave our hormones at the door.

<strong>The comments along the lines of 'this should not offend you' or 'I'm and R<a href="http://loudthinking.com/posts/39-im-an-r-rated-individual">rated person</a> - deal with it'</strong>

Quite frankly, I was not surprised. This is the same type of comments that I get whenever I mention the whole women-in-IT thing. It's also why I try to not to post too many entries on the subject matter (obviously sometimes I feel the need to speak out about the latest injustice)

<strong>The comments along the lines of 'this is bad. How about we all grow up'</strong>

Wow. Every time I read a comment like that, it negated any bad feeling I got from the other type of comments. It is great knowing that there are a large number of people out there, people of influence especially, who are on 'your side'. When people like <a title="Martin Fowler" href="http://martinfowler.com/">Martin Fowler</a> speak out about the<a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/SmutOnRails.html"> Smut in Rails</a>, it really makes you feel like you are on the right side. At <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com">Thoughtworks</a>, we had an internal discussion on a mailing list about this, and I was just waiting for someone to say 'hey, its not so bad', but still I can't believe that everyone I talk to about this strongly believes that this is inappropriate. So, thankyou for all who believe in this, and especially thankyou for all those people in a position in power who not only believe in it but also speak out about it.

<strong>In Summary</strong>

Was I offended by the presentation? I don't know; I wasn't there, so I don't feel that I can really comment.

Was I offended by the reactions and the aftermath? Yeah, I was, although I was not surprised.

Would I want to get in my DeLorean and stop Matt from doing the presentation? Hell-to-the-no. I think that we should embrace this storm and let it be a catalyst to changing our minds, our behavior and our industry.
