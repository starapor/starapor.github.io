Someone shared an observation with me today regarding the way ThoughtWorkers talk when referring to classes. Apparently, we say <em>"this guy"</em> a lot; as in "<em>this guy</em> has the responsibility for that action".

After thinking about it, I guess that's what happens when you live in the code.Â (Or, just a habit that one person started which has infiltrated everyone's vocabulary.)
