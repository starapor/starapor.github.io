<strong>What happened to People over Process?</strong>
When the Agile Manifesto was written, it was decided that there were only four simple statements at the heart of Agile. So, it is with great sadness that, when we scrutinise most teams, we discover the first, and arguably most important, of these statements is disregarded. Teams focus on Processes and Tools, rather than Individuals and Interactions. 

This session aims to redress this balance, by focusing on what it means to value the individuals on the project and their interactions. We will take a dive into the human psyche, to see what happens behind the mask, take a trip into what it means to be a team, instead of just a group of individuals before finally exploring what it means to be a leader in an Agile team.

<strong>The three pronged approach to integrating systems</strong>
How often do you get to work on isolated systems? More often than not your system needs to integrate with other another system, whether it be a legacy system, an external API or even one that has not yet been developed. Every integration point adds risk to your project: technical risk, quality risk and delivery risk. But never fear - help is at hand! Come to this talk and you will hear: - How to design your system to decrease risk, - How to ensure the quality of the overall system is high, and - How to manage the delivery of the system in a way that guarantees success You will hear real-life cases - some success and many failures. You too can learn from the mistakes I witnessed.

<strong>Pairing 101</strong>
Pairing isn't really a technique, it's a skill and as such some people are better than others but everyone can practice being a better pair. Pairing is not universally better than solo programming, it tends to be more time consuming but produces better quality code and spreads understanding of the codebase around a team. No more getting stuck if the "Message Bus Guy" isn't in the office.

Pairing 101 aims to introduce what kind of activities are good for pairing and which aren't. It will also try to explain how you can develop your skills and also explain how to be an absolutely atrocious pair.
In his book Outliers, Gladwell shares the story of a Korean airliner crash caused by issues in the cockpit. That example brings to mind the excitement and challenges of what would seem to be the simplest of XP practices: pair programming. Simple on the surface (2 people, 1 computer); challenging in reality, we will dig into the tricks and benefits of effectively pair programming. Join us for a fun, interactive session as we identify concerns teams face when starting to pair, explore the many benefits of pairing, and give you our best tips and techniques to make your pairing more effective!

<strong>Taming of the View</strong>
We know that testing is important; that separation of concerns is important; that modeling our domain is important; and that their are often many domains within an application. So why is it that most of the view engines make it so easy to break all these important activities?

View engines, such as erubis and ERB, make it so easy to break the model-view-controller-paradigm by allowing turing-complete code in the view. It is so easy to pull the database into the template by making calls such as <%= Order.find(:all, :conditions => { :status => 1 }) %>. Oh no! Now separation of concerns is thrown out the window, closely followed by testability and domain modeling.

Never fear - there is a better way! By following the teachings of String Template, we can introduce a strict enforcement of the model-view-controller-paradigm. In this session, we will highlight the problems with the existing engines, explore the possibilities of String Template and introduce Slippers - the ruby port of string template.
