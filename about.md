Sarah has more than a decade of experience working as a technologist for [ThoughtWorks](http://thoughtworks.com "ThoughtWorks"). During this time, she has specialised in enterprise modernisation, helping client organisations modernise their systems, processes, people and platforms. 

Today, Sarah leads ThoughtWorks Australia's Enterprise Modernisation, Platforms and Cloud (EMPC) practice in Australia. 

The most majestic places she's visited include the fjords of Norway and the mud pits of New Zealand. Lockdown 2020 made her appreciate the quiet as much as the noise and chaos. She finds writing personal abstracts in the third person very weird.
